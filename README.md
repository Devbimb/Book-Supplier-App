### Overview
_This app allows book suppliers to manage their books. It will allow suppliers to login and get information about request to supply book to library, schools, company and individual._ 
#
### Abstract
_This app was created using a **Spring Boot API**, with utilization of supporting tools, methodologies, and technologies that encapsulate an application of back-end developed using **Java** Programming Fundamentals, a managed database **(MySQL)** hosted locally on **Port 8086**, a means of making API Calls using **Postman** and a means of checking persistence using **Workbench 8.0 console**. The whole concept of this project is as detailed in **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)** presented here, but due to time constraints and for the purpose of fulfilling the Software Developement Training, only two entities are our focus, that is, Employee **(Supplier)** and Resources **(Book)**.  Since, we are implementing in **Agile environment**, the project would be updated with other features in the future work._

### Documentation
* Why Book Supplier App <br>
  The motivation for building this App stems from:
  * minimizing time spent on maintaining record of books and customer needs
  * eliminating delays in book supply to library, schools etc
  * efficiency in seraching for books
  * reduction of cubersome of maintaining several documents
  * overall reduction of operating cost and time spent.
 
 * Expectation of the Project <br>
   There are several entities required to complete the functionality of this system with the expectation    of making it avalaible to the appropriate stakeholders within a short period of time.
 
 * What Went Well <br>
   * The work done showed my capability as at the time of executing this project.
   * Culmination of all the topics I have learnt as part of my training
   * The reports includes evidence of my understanding of the topics I have learnt and wider reading
   * Ability provision by qualified and experienced QA trainer, "Upasana", gave me the confidence
   * The commitment given to help by my trainer, "Upasana", is a testimony to the success of this            project.
   * Ongoing learning during the execution of the project is one of the of the things I really liked          about my project.
   * The general support of the QA via access to QA Community and Cloud Academy has given me the              opportunity to always go back to learn whenever I am stucked.
   * Also, I think what equally helped me was always asking questions in class whenever I lack                understanding of what we are doing.
   * I think I did well in my conceptual design.  I thought, it was detailed and had good information.
   * Two entities have been coded and completed and the results have somewhat successful.

 * What didn't go as Planned <br>
   * Inability to implement all features
   * Lauching to website
   * More depth and detail of the two entities implemented
   * Full implementation in agile framework
 
 * Improvements for future revisions of the project <br>   
   * more depth of analysis and detail for some of other entities
   * improvement on the structure of the project
   * improvement on the structure of the report
   * comprehensiveness of the tools and technology like including web security
   * Project excution in DevOps and Agile enviroments
   * More hands on coding skills
   * Researchiing more into book management systems
   
 * Improvements for future revisions of the project <br>
