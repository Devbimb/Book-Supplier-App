### Overview
_This app allows book suppliers to manage their books. It will allow suppliers to login and get information about request to supply book to library, schools, company and individual._ 
#
### Abstract
_This app was created using a **Spring Boot API**, with utilization of supporting tools, methodologies, and technologies that encapsulate an application of back-end developed using **Java** Programming Fundamentals, a managed database **(MySQL)** hosted locally on **Port 8086**, a means of making API Calls using **Postman** and a means of checking persistence using **Workbench 8.0 console**. The whole concept of this project is as detailed in **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)** presented here, but due to time constraints and for the purpose of fulfilling the Software Developement Training, only two entities are our focus, that is, Employee **(Supplier)** and Resources **(Book)**.  Since, we are implementing in **Agile environment**, the project would be updated with other features in the future work._
